# Best checkers in human history

Rules are not enforced, which a feature, I will add option to enforce rules and automatic moves later, or maybe not. Also it would be nice to make proper 3D models, but this will be only after I learn Blender 

Controls:
* LMB = hold a checker in the air. Stop pressing the button to release it
* RMB = rotate a checker upside down. Use it to mark
* MMB = rotate the camera to another player
* Space = (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ (to be improved)

There will be an `itch.io` page as soo as I manage to build this thing
